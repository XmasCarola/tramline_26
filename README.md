# Tramline 26

This repo contains a set of exercises where searching and ordering algorithms in C - including sequential sort, bubble sort, merge sort and quick sort - are applied.

There is a standalone piece of code, after which this repo is titled, conceived to calculate the ultimate available ride to reach a destination before a given time, considering direction and starting point.
