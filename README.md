# Tramline 26

This repo contains a set of exercises where searching and ordering algorithms in C - including sequential sort, bubble sort, merge sort and quick sort - are applied.

There is a standalone piece of code designed to calculate the earliest time a tram is expected to pass, given time (timetables are evaluated on selected ranges), direction and nearest stop.
